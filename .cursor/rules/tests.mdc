Before running tests execute `ops ide login` and ask user to provide the credentials.

When you need  to test a <module> of <tool> in <package> , access the modules with:

```
import sys
sys.path.append("packages/<package>/<tool>")
import <module>
```

Do not use mocks or stubs, use the actual services in preferences. Ask the user to provide the secrets adding them to `.env`.

Assume you can access relevant services (redis, postgres, milvus, s3) using environment variables that are provided.

Test the <function>s and <class>ess in the <module> referring to them as

<module>.<function> or <module>.<class>
