Once you finished the implementation, deploy the tool or actions and add it to the index file `packages/mastrogpt/index/90-Test.json`.

You need a $HOME/.wskprops file to deploy a tool. If it does not exists  execute `ops ide login` and ask the user to provide the credentials.

You can then deploy a <tool> and the index executing: 

```
ops ide deploy mastrogpt/index
ops ide deploy <package>/<tool>
```
