When you neeed a <SECRET>, ask to add it to `.env` and check it is there. Do not add it yourself.

When you find the secret, add to the file `__main__.py` the metadata comment:

#-p <SECRET> "$<SECRET>"

Do not add this code directly to the `__main__.py` Retrieve the secret either from the args and the env with:

<SECRET> = args.get("<SECRET>", os.getenv("<SECRET>")

in the function invoked by `main`

Assume in tests the secrets are available in the environment.
